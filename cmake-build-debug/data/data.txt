I'm currently in my 4th year as an indie, developing NEO Scavenger, after leaving a full-time job, and pretty closely followed the path you describe. In fact, I decided to blog about the experience of going solo, so others could learn from my example the way I did from others before me.

There's a lot of content in there, so I'll list a few highlights below. However, each post roughly reflects what was going on in my mind and life at the time, so you can trace an arc of my experiences. Also, I stopped blogging roughly one year ago, since most of my questions and concerns were gravitating towards day-to-day operations. Those daily thoughts and work logs can be read on my Blue Bottle Games devlog.
